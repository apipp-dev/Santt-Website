export const faqData = [
  {
    question: 'How long does a cinematic brand shoot typically take from script to debut?',
    answer: 'A standard project spans 3 to 6 weeks. This includes pre-production (storyboarding, scripts - approx. 1-2 weeks), principal photography (shooting - 1-3 days), and a highly detailed post-production phase (color grading, sound design, revisions - 2-4 weeks). Rush delivery options are available at an additional premium.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we hire Santt Production strictly for raw FPV drone pilot capture or elite color grading?',
    answer: 'Absolutely! While we focus on full-service narrative campaigns, we partner with agencies and other directors to supply high-end FPV flight captures, ARRI Mini B-rolls, or dedicated DaVinci color grading. Contact our producer desk for custom service packages tailored to your needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are there any geographical limitations for production locations?',
    answer: 'None whatsoever. Santt Production has filmed on icy mountain cliffs, remote desert dunes, and underground water reservoirs. Our crew, gear, and heavy drone certifications are optimized for challenging terrain across Aceh, Indonesia, and beyond. Custom logistics planning available.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is your process for integrating feedback during post-production?',
    answer: 'We use professional frame-by-frame review portals (Frame.io sync). You receive a secure link where you can click exact timecodes and write notes. This keeps the revision workflow high-speed and transparent throughout editing, color grading, and final delivery phases.'
